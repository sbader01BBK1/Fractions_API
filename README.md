This repo contains an API written in Java for handling Fraction objects. 

This includes:

- Three constructors allowing fractions to be initialised using either 2 integers (numer./denom.), 1 integer
  (numer./1), or a string (which can either represent a whole number or a fraction).
- Simple mathematical operation methods (add/subtract/multiply/divide)
- Sign and value modification methods (abs/negate/inverse)
- Comparator and toString methods (equals/compareTo/toString)

Methods have been tested extensively.
